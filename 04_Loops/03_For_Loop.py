For Loop : 
Syntax : 
for i in range (1,11):      #Here i range starts from 1 to 10. It will include the left number but exclude the right number. 
    Code()                   So if the value is 11 then the loop breaks. Also by default the value increased by 1. if you want to increase by 4 or 5.
    Code()                   Then need mention that in for loop

eg. 
for i in range(1,11,2)      Here 1 is starting point of loop and 11 is breaking point of loop. now mentioned 2 is used to increase the number
    code()                  eg 1+2=3;3+2=5.......and so on    
    code()
